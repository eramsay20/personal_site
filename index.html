										<h2 class="major">Early Days</h2>
										<p>After graduating from Bowdoin College with a degree in Economics, I sought opportunities to learn all I could about finance. Fresh out of school I spent a year at one of the most risk-averse employers in the US, a F500 insurance company called Unum Group. After about a year of 9-5 stability, I longed for a faster-paced environment that would challenge me. </p>
										
										<p>Shortly into my search an opportunity came up to take an 80% pay cut and begin life anew as an entry level investment analyst at a top-tier VC firm in Shanghai. I signed right away, moved to China a month later and settled in for a new adventure overseas. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Life In the Startup World</h2>
										<p>Needless to say, the move was an adjustment! In this new role at SOSV, a global leader in startup accelerator programs, I was thrown in the fire to learn faster than ever before. While representing one of the world's leading early stage investment firms, I was able to connect with, learn from, coach and fund top tier mobile internet software startups from around the globe looking to expand their business into China. </p>
										
										<p>After ~18 months at SOSV, traveling around Asia and completing ~25 venture deals with promising startups, I found myself itching to join one. Opportunity came knocking once again in December, 2016, when a close friend found a role at a budding fintech startup called eShares based in San Francisco. This role would give me an opportunity to learn how to value a company and connect directly with its founders and board members to learn how their businesses ticked. While hopeful that the company I was joining would itself succeed, this role was exactly what I was looking for to fill my knowledge gaps in valuation. I couldn't have known at the time that this budding startup would one day become a multi-billion dollar unicorn, currently known as Carta.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Growing Through A Pandemic</h2>
										<p>After a few years at Carta (formerly eShares), I decided to try and bring some balance to my life and move back closer to family who had all moved to Maryland. At the time, remote work opportunities were still relatively few and far between, so ultimately this move meant leaving Carta. With my equity gains I decided to explore real estate investing, got my license and started to learn the ropes just as COVID-19 decided to turn the world on its head. </p>
										
										<p>With a newfound time to step back and reflect on which direction I wanted to head to next, I watched my wife May complete a 6-month software training bootcamp. While she worked from home, I had the benefit of seeing her developer life in action behind the scenes, and even was able to study her learning materials myself. I found I absorbed materials quickly, and felt the thrill of solving a new challenging problem. Having worked with developers and entrepreneurs for years already, I decided to put my skill sets and network to use and become a full stack developer myself. </p>
											
										<p>As I looked into which programs could offer me the most in-depth and comprehensive experience for such a limited time of only 6 months, App Academy stood out amongst its competitors and I joined its full-stack software engineering program in December, 2020. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Recent Projects</h2>
									<p>The six months I spent at App Academy ended up yielding some of the best learning experiences of my career. By learning two full end-to-end stacks (JavaScript & Python) I was able to cement fundamentals from one language while learning another. Having repeated the same core concepts applied to two different tech stacks with completely different syntaxes, I feel far more prepared to learn a 3rd, 4th and whatever else will be required of on me in my next developer role. As a brief showcase of these skill sets, below are a few projects that were put together in a single week while at App Academy. Please do feel free to play around with them (Hint: click the login >> login as Demo User for added functionality!!) </p>
