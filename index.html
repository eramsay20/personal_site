										<h2 class="major">Early Days</h2>
										<p>After graduating from Bowdoin College with a degree in Economics, I sought opportunities to learn all I could about finance. For my first job out of school I spent a little over a year at one of the most risk averse employers in the US, a Fortune 500 insurance company. After about a year I longed for more of a challenge. Shortly into my search an opportunity came up to take an 80% pay cut and begin life anew as an entry level investment analyst at a top-tier VC firm in Shanghai. I signed right away and moved to China a month later. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Life In the Startup World</h2>
										<p>Needless to say, it was an adjustment! This new role at SOSV, a global leader in startup accelerator programs, gave me precisely what I hoped for. As one of the leading early stage investment firms in the world, I was able to connect with, learn from, coach and fund top tier mobile software startups from around the world looking to break tackle the China market. </p>
										
										<p>After 18 months having completed over ~25 deals across Shanghai and Taipei, I found myself itching to join a startup myself. Opportunity came knocking once again in December, 2016, when a close friend found a role at a budding fintech startup called eShares based in San Francisco. This role would give me an opportunity to learn how to value a company and connect 1:1 with its founders to learn how their businesses tick. While hopeful that the company itself would succeed, this next step was exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't have known at the time that this budding startup would one day become a multi-billion dollar unicorn, called Carta... but 5 years later, here we are! </p>

										<h2 class="major">Growing Through A Pandemic</h2>
										<p>After a few years at Carta (formerly eShares), I decided to try and bring some balance to my life and move back closer to family who had all moved to Maryland. At the time, remote work opportunities were still relatively few and far between, so ultimately this move meant leaving Carta. With my equity gains I decided to explore real estate investing, got my license and started to learn the ropes just as COVID-19 decided to turn the world on its head. </p>
										
										<p>With a newfound time to step back and reflect on which direction I wanted to head to next, I watched my wife May complete a 6-month software training bootcamp. While she worked from home, I had the benefit of seeing her developer life in action behind the scenes, and even was able to study her learning materials myself. I found I absorbed materials quickly, and felt the thrill of solving a new challenging problem. Having worked with developers and entrepreneurs for years already, I decided to put my skill sets and network to use and become a full stack developer myself. As I looked into which programs could offer me the most in-depth and comprehensive experience for such a limited time of only 6 months, App Academy stood out amongst its competitors and I joined its full-stack software engineering program in December, 2020. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Recent Projects</h2>
									<p>The six months I spent at App Academy ended up yielding some of the best learning experiences of my career. By lerning two full end-to-end stacks (JavaScript & Python) I was able to cement fundamentals from one language while learning another. Having repeated the same core concepts applied to two different tech stacks with completely different syntaxes, I feel far more prepared to learn a 3rd, 4th and whatever else is required of on me in my next developer role. As a brief showcase of these skill sets, below are a few projects that were put together in a single week while at App Academy. Please do feel free to play around with them (Hint: click the login >> login as Demo User for added functionality!!) </p>
